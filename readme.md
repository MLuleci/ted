A toy Text EDitor written in Rust.

This is my very first Rust project which I am using to learn Rust itself. As such, this project is not meant as a serious offering. The editor has (or will have) some basic features not too dissimilar to other simple editors like [GNU nano](https://nano-editor.org/). The code *should* be flexible enough to implement some more advanced features in the future -if one ever feels inclined- such as multiple cursors support.

**Warning:** Do not edit any important files with this editor.

To fetch dependencies and compile, simply run `cargo run` (isn't Rust great?)
